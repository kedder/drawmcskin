# Draw Minecraft Skin

This is a simple weekend project to help kids create their own minecraft skins. Use this tool to generate the 
template, print it out and draw the character on it. Then take a photo of the drawing and feed it to the program.
You'll get the skin file that you can import into Minecraft.
